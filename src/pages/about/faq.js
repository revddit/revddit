    <p>On <NewWindowLink reddit='/settings/emails'>reddit.com/settings/emails</NewWindowLink> turn on "Replies to your comments" and "Comments on your posts". You may need to first uncheck "Unsubscribe from all emails" at the bottom. Checking "Inbox messages" has no impact on this. That will send an email containing the content and author of every reply. As of September of 2022, this still includes auto-removed content*.</p>
    <p>To stop getting notifications for a certain post, uncheck "Send Me Reply Notifications" under the "..." on new Reddit, or hit "disable inbox replies" on old Reddit. That stops both the emails and in-app notifications. Replies that aren't removed will still be recorded in your /message/inbox.</p>
    <p>Regarding, Why do reply notifications link to pages that say "That Comment Is Missing" or "there doesn't seem to be anything here"? In such cases, the comment may have been removed before it was viewed, and subscribing to emails for replies may provide some insight.</p>
    <p>*Around July-September 2022, some moderators asked Reddit to stop sending emails for auto-removed comments.

  shadowban: {
    header: 'What is a shadowban?',
    content: <>
      <p>
        A shadowban hides all of a user's content from public view without alerting them to the ban. It can be applied within a given subreddit by that group's moderators, or site-wide by Reddit admins.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reveddit can indicate both subreddit-based and site-wide shadowbans via a user's profile. A subreddit shadowban looks like <NewWindowLink href='https://archive.ph/ktKp1'>this</NewWindowLink>, where all content for one subreddit is removed. In some cases it may indicate the user does not meet certain subreddit requirements, such as karma, age, and having a verified email.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2020, Reddit's Automoderator documentation was changed to refer to the subreddit shadowban as a {botban}. For more details, see <NewWindowLink reddit='/r/reveddit/comments/sxpk15/fyi_my_thoughts_on_the_new_true_block_and_the/ieozb29/'>the history of automoderator and subreddit shadowbans</NewWindowLink>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples of site-wide shadowbanned users may be found in <NewWindowLink reddit='/r/ShadowBan'>r/ShadowBan</NewWindowLink>. After a period of time, Reddit may suspend shadowbanned accounts. Places where Reddit has addressed the topic include:

      <p>An exception was made for titles and links of user-deleted submissions on thread pages. That means someone would need the link to the content in order to see the title and user-submitted URL, and it still would not show the username. User pages never show any user-deleted content. Titles and links provide basic context necessary to review discussions. These are now restored via the archive service because at some point in early 2022 Reddit began overwriting the titles and links of three-month-old user-deleted posts.</p>

        <li>Only Reddit's <code>delete</code> button removes content from Reveddit. A moderator can also use the <code>remove</code> button on their own content in subs they moderate. In that case the content will still appear on Reveddit.</li>
        <li>If a moderator removes a comment, and then later the author deletes the comment, that comment will not appear on Reveddit user pages and may still appear in Reveddit threads. The Reddit API does not have a way to show when authors delete mod-removed comments.</li>

Reveddit is unaffiliated. Pushshift can fall behind, fail to archive content, or go offline. If a comment is removed before it is archived then it may not appear on Reveddit. It may be possible to <a href={'#'+unarchived_search_button_word_lc}>restore</a> comments from a user page. Your /user page will always be up to date since that only relies on data from Reddit.</p>

      <p>The <code>mod/auto</code> label (formerly marked as <code>unknown</code>) is applied when Reveddit cannot determine if something was removed manually by a mod or removed automatically by automod, Reddit's spam filter, or another bot. Pushshift, a database that captures Reddit data as it is created, and which Reveddit queries, can fall behind or fail to retrieve data. When that happens, any removed items are marked as <code>[removed] by mod/auto</code>. When Pushshift captures content soon after creation, and the content has already been removed, then it is marked as <code>[removed] automatically</code>. If Pushshift has a record of a removed comment's body then the comment is labeled <code>[removed] by mod</code>. More detail can be found in the <a href='https://github.com/reveddit/reveddit/blob/60a34a28c5133fd54777d189fc9997afe89a2f39/src/data_processing/comments.js#L131'>source code</a>.</p>
      <p>Note, when an account is suspended by Reddit, all the posts and comments for that account may be removed. The Reddit API does not indicate where suspension-related removals occur and so Reveddit cannot see or mark where this happens.
